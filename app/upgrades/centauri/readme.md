## Migrate Chain Prefix from Banksy to Centauri
As part of our system upgrade, we need to migrate the chain prefix from Banksy to Centauri.

To start the migration process, we will need to follow these steps:

1. Update the node software: We need to update the node software to the latest version that supports the Centauri chain prefix. 
2. Backup the your consensus key data: Before we start the migration process, it is important to backup all the data . Make sure that your `priv_validator_key.json` is backup.
3. Stop the current node: When the block heigh reach `150500`. Validator need to stop their node.
4. Start the new node: Once the configuration is complete, we can start the new node with the `Centauri`  prefix.

By following these steps, we can ensure a smooth and successful migration from Banksy to Centauri. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact our support team.
